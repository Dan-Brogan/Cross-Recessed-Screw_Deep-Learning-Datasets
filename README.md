# Cross-Recessed-Screw Deep Learning Datasets
This repository contains the following cross-recessed-screw (CRS) datasets for use with the Tiny-You Only Look Once v2 (Tiny-YOLO v2) deep learning object detection system:

1) Training dataset: 900 images and corresponding ground-truth annotation files of CRS embedded in general hardware.
2) Test Set A: 90 images and corresponding ground-truth annotation files of CRS embedded in general hardware. This set may be used for training validation.
3) Test Set B: 90 images and corresponding ground-truth annotation files of laptops
4) Test Set C: 90 images and corresponding ground-truth annotation files of boxed electronics including power supplies, power tools, and oscilloscopes.

Each image is exclusive to its own dataset. All images were taken with a Google Pixel 12.3 MPx (3036 x 4048 pixels) camera.
The research which developed these datasets is currently under review.
The authors include Daniel P. Brogan, Nicholas M. DiFilippo, and Musa K. Jouaneh.
